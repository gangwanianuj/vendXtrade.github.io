                which form part of the Margin, against any dues of the Client or of a member of the group of the

                respective obligations under these Terms.</p>
            <p class="text-grey">The client agrees and authorises vendXtrade to determine the market value of
                securities placed as margin after applying a haircut that vendXtrade may deem appropriate. The client
                undertakes to monitor the market value of such securities on a continuous basis. The client further
                undertakes to replenish any shortfall in the value of the margin consequents to a fall in the market
                value of such securities placed as margin immediately whether or not vendXtrade intimates such
                shortfall.</p>
            <p class="text-grey">vendXtrade may at its sole discretion prescribe the payment of Margin in the form of
                cash instead of or in addition to margin in form of securities. The Client accepts to comply with
                the requirement of vendXtrade with regards to payment of Margin in the form of cash immediately.
                Without prejudice to the stock broker's other rights (including the right to refer a matter to
                arbitration), the stock broker shall be entitled to liquidate / close out all or any of the client's
                positions for non- payment of margins or other amount, outstanding debts, etc., and adjust the
                proceeds of such liquidation / close out, if any, against the client's liabilities / obligations.
                Any and all losses and financial charges on account of such liquidation / closing-out shall be
                charged to and borne by the client.</p>
            <p class="text-grey">The client agrees to abide by the exposure limits, if any, set by the stock broker

                sufficient in times of extreme volatility and trading terminals of vendXtrade may get temporarily
                suspended because of the cumulative effect of non-meeting of obligation by various clients as per

                vendXtrade for any loss that they might incur on account of such suspension of trading.</p>
            <p class="text-grey">The Client agrees that any securities/cash placed by him/her/it as margin may in
                turn be placed as margin by vendXtrade with the Exchanges or banks or such other institution as vendXtrade
                may deem fit. The Client authorises vendXtrade to do all such acts, deeds and things as may be
                necessary and expedient for placing such securities/cash with the Exchanges/Banks/Institutions as
                margin.</p>

                mentioned in the client account master in the Back office software maintained
                centrally. No other separate software is maintained for maintaining client
                account details. Thus every attempt is made to redress the grievance/problems of the clients
                and introduce systematic changes into the processes so that such instances are
                avoided.
