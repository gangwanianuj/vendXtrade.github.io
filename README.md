The trading website project offers a seamless trading experience for cryptocurrency and forex traders. It encompasses various SDLC phases, including requirements analysis, design, implementation, and testing. The system architecture supports smooth integration of backend, front-end, APIs, and databases. Front end uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap; backend employs PHP, and MySQL serves as the database. A detailed SRS document outlines functional and non-functional requirements, system features, and UI design. The project includes high-level (HLD) and low-level (LLD) designs. HLD covers system architecture, component, and deployment diagrams; LLD entails database schema, data flow, and sequence diagrams. The website facilitates efficient trading and can evolve with new features like advanced analytics and social trading, promising a robust future scope.
